    In a world where the facets of humanity and eerie mystery are mixed, there is an ancient species - ghouls. They don't just look for food in people, but feed on their flesh and souls. However, most ghouls strive to keep a spark of humanity in themselves, even if it means living in constant danger.

<p>
<i>
    Land of the Lustrous is set in a far, distant future where the Earth had been struck six times by meteorites, ravaging it in the process. All of the remaining land was reduced to a single coast, and nearly all life was destroyed. Over vast stretches of time, a new race of sentient lifeforms emerged; immortal jewels that take the form of people.
